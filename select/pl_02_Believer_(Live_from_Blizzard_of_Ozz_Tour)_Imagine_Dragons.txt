Watching the time go
And feeling belief grow
Rise above the obstacles
Doubts will arise, though
Like chasing a rainbow
Speculation of the wise
(Feels nice)
I'm a believer
I ain't no receiver
Mountains move before my eyes
Destiny planned out
I don't need no handout
Speculation of the wise
(Feels nice)
You've got to believe
in yourself
Coz no one will believe in you
Imagination like a bird
on the wing
Flying free for you to use
(Ok, baby)
I can't believe they stop
and stare
And point their fingers,
doubting me
Their disbelief suppresses them
But they're not blind,
it's just that they won't see
I'm a believer
I ain't no receiver
Mountains move before my eyes
Destiny planned out
I don't need no handout
Speculation of the wise
(Feels nice)

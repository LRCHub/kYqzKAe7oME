I speak my mind, I don't hold it back
That's how I am and I'm hoping that's where you're at
Like I lay it on the line, I think that's how it should be
If you're gonna make it, man, you've got to agree

I'm a stone cold believer, yes, I am
I believe you can do it if you say that you can
I'm a stone cold believer, not a smooth talking man
Believe I got things well at hand

Wanna climb that ladder, you wanna make it to the top
Takes only one thing, gotta give it all you got
Knew a man who couldn't lose 'cause he never gave in
He stuck to his pistol, well, it made him a better man

I'm a stone cold believer, yes, I am
I believe you can do it if you say that you can
I'm a stone cold believer, not a smooth talking man
Believe I got things well at hand

I'm a stone cold believer, yes, I am
I believe you can do it if you say that you can
I'm a stone cold believer, not a smooth talking man
Believe I got things well at hand

Stone cold believer, yes, I am
I believe you can do it if you say that you can
I'm a stone cold believer, not a smooth talking man
I believe I got things well at hand

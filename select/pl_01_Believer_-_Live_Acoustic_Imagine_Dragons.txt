One, two, three
First things first
I'ma say
all the words inside my head
I'm fired up
and tired of the way
that things have been, oh-ooh
Ah,
the way that things have been,
oh-ooh
Second things second
Don't you tell me
what you think that I could be
I'm the one at the sail,
I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh
Oh, the master of my sea, oh-ooh
I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulking to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
Who look at me, took on me,
shook on me, feeling me
Singing from heartache
from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson
from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...
Pain!
You made me a,
you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down
you build me up,
believer, believer
Pain!
Let the bullets fly,
oh let them rain
My life, my love, my drive,
it came from...
Pain!
You made me a,
you made me a believer, believer
Third things third
Send a prayer
to the ones up above
All the hate
you've heard has turned
your spirit to a dove, oh-ooh
Yeah, your spirit up above,
oh-ooh
I was choking in the crowd
Building my rain up in the cloud
Falling like ashes to the ground
Hoping my feelings,
they would drown
But they never did, ever lived,
ebbing and flowing,
inhibited, limited
'Til it broke open
and rained down
And rained down, like...
Pain!
You made me a,
you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down
you build me up,
believer, believer
Pain!
Let the bullets fly,
oh let them rain
My life, my love, my drive,
it came from...
Pain!
You made me a,
you made me a believer, believer
Last things last
By the grace of the fire
and the flame
You're the face of the future,
the blood in my veins, oh-ooh
You're the blood in my veins,
oh-ooh
But they never did, ever lived,
ebbing and flowing, inhibited,
limited
'Til it broke open
and rained down
It rained down, like...
Pain!
You made me a,
you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down,
you build me up,
believer, believer
Pain!
Let the bullets fly,
oh let them rain
My life, my love, my drive,
it came from...
Pain!
You made me a,
you made me a believer, believer
